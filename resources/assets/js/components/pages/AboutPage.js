          <div>I’m fortunate enough to love what I do. I’ve been implementing software for over 8+ years working in a wide variety of environments and languages for small businesses, large corporations and out on my own doing freelance work. I am a developer with good insights of front-end UI development. I am passionate about everything JavaScript, and I love to explore new libraries. You can follow my latest work over at github.com and ownbook.herokuapp.com.</div>
